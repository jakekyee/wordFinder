 Translated phonemes to numbers for use in a memory system. 
 
 w, h, y = Null
 d, t = 1
 n = 2
 m = 3
 r = 4

 k, g = 7

 Examples
 dog = 17 
 crocodile = 74715


NOTE: Didn't know how to deal with SQL number at the time and couldn't get leading zeros to work. All zeros are replaced with a capital "o". So to find Snowball (0295) the correct thing to search for is O295
